# Introduction

Welcome to the final week of the Machine Learning Challenge. In this week you will test the skills that you acquired over the past 5 weeks, in the form of a competition. 

You will have to solve a problem based on a real-world dataset and compete with your colleagues for a place on the leader-board.

There is an extra challenge in the form of a Benchmark that you need to beat but showing up on the leader-board is a big win in itself.

Pay attention to the data in the dataset \(read the extra documentation around it\) and use Mattermost channel for questions.

For a nice portfolio project you can create a notebook with detailed steps and code and host it on your GitHub account. This will be mandatory for the first 3 places and also used as a tie-breaker.

See our _**How To Kaggle**_ notebook for some extra info

Our own solution to the final project will be posted after the competition ends.
