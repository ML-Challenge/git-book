# Introduction

Data analysis is an exploratory process that often starts with specific questions. It requires curiosity, the desire to find answers and a good level of tenacity, because those answers arenâ€™t always easy to come by.

Data visualisation involves the visual representation of data, ranging from single charts to comprehensive dashboards. Effective visualisations significantly reduce the amount of time it takes for your audience to process information and access valuable insights.

In this week's challenge you will learn the basics of NumPy, pandas and matplotlib.

Lessons:

1. **NumPy** - NumPy is a fundamental Python package to efficiently practice data science. In this lesson you will learn to work with such powerful tools as the NumPy array, and get started with data exploration.
2. **matplotlib** - With matplotlib, you can create a bunch of different plots in Python
3. **pands** - We use pandas to import, inspect and manipulate a variety of datasets,
