# Exercises

There are no guided exercises this week; instead, we ask you to do the de following:

* Explore the [toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html) that come with scikit-learn
* Pick at least 2, one for classification and one for regression
* Create a notebook for each of them and explore different [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) classification and regression algorithms.
* For extra credits post the notebooks on GitHub and share the link in Week 3's MatterMost channel.
